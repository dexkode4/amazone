This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Hi my name is Kabiru haruna i'm making this quick video so that you can easily know a little about me.I'm a software engineer trainee at Decagon institute. I'm from nasarawa state although I was born and raised in lagos state . I graduated from the university of ilorin kwara state with a degree in bachelor of science statistics.
During my nysc service year i was opportune to take a leadership role as a mathematics tutor in a local government owned school in the city zungeru ,Niger state. Despite the language barrier I was able to communicate and get along with folks in the community.
My hobbies are quite few, I enjoy watching movies , playing video games, talking about tech related topics and coding. Coding welcomes anyone with open arms , no matter who you are or where you're from . All you need is a notepad and the world becomes your canvas. Just like how coding allowed me to be more open to the world, I want to help make the world more open and connected.

Decagon has showed me that there isn't any limit to what you can achieve and the ability to learn not just tech stuff but anything. and also adapt to changes.
